<br>
<h4><b>Carbon Footprint Calculator</b><h4>
<p>
    <br>
Carbon Footprint calculator isn't an actual model, its based on data analysis, its basically automated data analysis.
If you still want to check it out, you may do so by looking it the backend files, especially "views.py"
</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73097560/115834477-dbab4500-a447-11eb-908a-139a6edaec5c.gif">

<h3 id="QNA">
<b>QNA</b>
</h3>
<br>
<h4><b>1.What our project basically targets to do?</b></h4>
<br>
=> Our project promotes sustainable environmental development and also features multiple applications such as a carbon footprint calculator , so that people are aware of their own carbon emission contributions, Not only does it calculate the carbon emissions it also suggests recommendations on how we can improve ourselves to have a better future!
<br>
Our project also has a Satellite image classification model which basically classifies the situation of any satellite image given to it, this will classify the probability of that particular area of having pollution, water, mine etc.
This can be used to identify your locality in a better way.
<br>
That's not all, we also analysed the air pollution index data from 2017 to 2022 and drew out multiple helpful insights, you can check the overall analysis too! This also has a predictive model to find out upcoming air pollution indices especially in India, the model isn't available to run in the website but you can run it locally in your computer(instructions are given near the jupyter notebook , or you can check the other questions too)

<br>
<h4><b>2.How can you access our project?</b></h4>
<br>
=> You are already in the correct place, you can view this overall repository to find out our work.
<br>
<h4><b>3.How can you run the Air Pollution Index model?</b></h4>
<br>
=> Due to github restrictions we can't upload this file here as its quite large, but you can check the python notebook used to make it in the AirQuality folder, besides that you can download the model from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uk9T_NtEy720BXKwOdFRbVcU8C0JGg9D/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.
Just extract the zip file and follow the instructions in the readme.txt
<br>
<h4><b>4.Which libraries and language are we using?</b></h4>
<br>
=> We are using python as a language for the overall logic and we are also using JavaScript in web development.For non-programming languages we are using html and css for web development.When it comes to libraries we are using matplotlib and seaborn because of their wonderful capabilities of creating visualizations, we are also using pandas and numpy for data management ,tensorflow keras for deep learning and sklearn for machine learning.
<br>
<h4><b>5.How is the backend working?</b></h4>
<br>
=> For the backend and server hosting we are using free tier of pythonanywhere. As a framework we are working with Django.

<br>
<h4><b>6.What is our project for?</b></h4>
<br>
=> Our project is solely made for sustainable environment development, we are creating it on the occasion of a wonderful hackathon organised by Geeksforgeeks which is called EchoTech, but besides for the hackathon we are also going to maintain this site after, and further developmental plans would be there for this website.

<br>
<h4> <b>7.What are the future plans for this website</b>h4>
<br>
=> We are going to maintain our website even after this hackathon ends, we already have plans like tourism recommendation system, social media updates on ecology, and many more! the updates would be coming soon be ready!
<br>
<h4><b>8.How did we come up with this idea?</b></h4>
<br>
=> We were really concerned about our environment, moreoever due to the beautful theme of the hackathon organised by GeeksForGeeks, we thought and found out the actual reasons for environmental degradation.Some Key factors are deforestation, and carbon emmissions. Our project exactly aims to spread awareness on that issue.

<h3 id="key-findings">
<b>Key Findings </b>
</h3>
<br>
<h4><b>From Air Quality Index</b></h4>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; list">
<li>In the year 2020, there was a sudden decrease in the air pollution, and resulted in a good air quality index, Most probably this was due to Corona Virus.</li>
<li>Each year, especially in the month of August, we have good air quality index, this should usually happen due to the phenomenon called "Wet Deposition"</li>
<li>Each day, during the time of 5AM , 12AM and 4-5PM, the air quality index shows a great change.This can be because these are considered as the business hours.</li>
<li>Pollution was at its peak in the year of 2018, it gradually decreased to 2020, and it slightly started to raise by 2021, by which we can predict almost about by this year or maybe the next, it would cross the air pollution of 2017!</li>

</ul>
<br>
<h4><b>From Satellite image classification</b></h4>
<p>
Not much insights were found in this, we trained a deep learning model instead.
</p>
<br>
<h4><b>From Carbon Footprint calculation</b></h4>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; list">
<li>Most of the countries use Oil for their electricity production, which usually exerts about 730g of Carbon per 1KWh, which is a bad news!</li>
<li>On an average electricity costs about $0.16 globally.</li>
<li>Globally, on an average each person emmits about 4.61 tonnes of carbon each year, while the target emmissions are less than or equal to 2.5 tonnes!</li>
<li>Carbon Dioxide mostly from gas is around 1.3 tonnes per year per person!</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="conclusion">
<b>Conclusion</b>
</h3>
In conclusion, the sustainable development of our ecosystem is not just a vision; it's a tangible reality that we are actively shaping through innovation and collective efforts. Our website, equipped with features like Satellite Image Classification, Carbon Footprint Calculator, and Air Quality Index Analysis, is a testament to our commitment to this cause. As we navigate the intricate web of data and technology, we discover the means to harmonize our existence with nature.

While our world is unmistakably progressing towards sustainability, the urgency of our situation cannot be overstated. Climate change and ecological degradation continue to challenge our planet. We must act swiftly, collectively, and decisively to preserve the delicate balance of our environment. Our mission is to not only provide tools for understanding and mitigating environmental impact but also to inspire action.

By embracing sustainable choices and advocating for change, we can accelerate this global transformation. Together, we have the power to safeguard our planet for generations to come. Let's work tirelessly, innovate relentlessly, and inspire one another to move swiftly towards a more sustainable future. Our planet's well-being depends on it.
